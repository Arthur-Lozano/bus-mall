## This application allows a user to click on the image 25 times displaying a different set of image each time a new set is rendered and then adds the number of votes and views up to output a total in the form of a chart.  Local storage is also utilized in order to ensure the numbers are not duplicated.  Lastly, not only can you hover over the chart to see the numbers of votes and views but you can also see them displayed below the chart itself.
